## CONCLUSION/FINDINGS
My findings is summarized as follows.
- Generally we have less females purchasing our products as against male
- Our product didnt do well in summer period
- we recorded lower sales from younger people than older people

## RECCOMENDATION
The marketing team will have to focus on the females to increase our females product purchase by producing more Yellow, Olive And Pink female products as thats the color our female customers purchased more. The team should include more youth related program in their campaign to attract more youths as we recorded less product purchase from youths under 30 especially males.
